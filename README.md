# Soothe 2.0

 <p align="center" width="400px"> <font size="5"> <b>Web application “Soothe”, helps people to deal with their mental illness and also help them in overcoming it. Millions of people are suffering from mental disorders but only a small percentage of them seek professional aid.

Recent years have seen important developments in preventive and therapeutic digital tools such as games, digital psychotherapies, etc. yet despite the potential interest in such tools to improve treatment of mental disorders and to help prevent them, the field remains understudied and information is under disseminated in clinical practice.

So we are here with an idea of developing an application platform soothe

1. To help the vulnerable population in not overlooking mental health.
2. To promote and avail mental health diagnosis and treatment at minor stages and prevent serious illness.
3. To support telemedicine and digital solutions for cognitive, emotional, mental aid.
